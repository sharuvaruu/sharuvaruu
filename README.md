# 👋 Hey There! I’m Sharvari Salodkar, but you can call me sharuvaruu! 


Welcome to my digital playground! I’m a tech enthusiast with a penchant for **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Large Language Models**. When I’m not diving into code or juggling algorithms, you’ll find me building solutions and honestly I am still figuring out in life!

Oh, and I’m also a writer by passion – because who doesn’t love a good story with their code? 📚

## 🔭 About Me

- **Name**: Sharvari Salodkar
- **Education**: B.Tech in Information Technology from SGGSIE&T

Currently, I’m knee-deep in developing **[Manasadhana](https://github.com/sharuvaruu/manasadhana)** – a project that’s on a mission to make mental health support as accessible as ordering a pizza (minus the cheesy jokes, of course).
